# Welcome, Hacktober participants! 👋🏽 

## Why This Project?
If you're looking for a meaningful repo to contribute to, this is one. Our goal is to collect as much information as we can about **District Attorneys** because prosecutors are the only figures who can charge cops with police brutality. As such, we believe prosecutors are a key contributor to the ongoing police violence against unarmed individuals. **Prosecutors who fail to hold cops accountable actively encourage police brutality**. Our mission with this web app is to help educate voters so that they *vote against* prosecutors who let cops engage in this violence. ([read more](https://github.com/billimarie/prosecutor-database/blob/master/DOCS.md#1-history-why-prosecutors))

## Who Can Contribute
This issue is perfect anyone looking to get their feet wet for Hacktober. From beginners learning to code or use GitHub, to intermediate & advanced developers who are interested in data science, we can use your help harvesting basic information about the nation's District Attorneys. (Unsurprisingly, a dataset of this magnitude does not already exist.) You can see what we currently have on our [live web app](https://us-prosecutor-database.herokuapp.com/). 

## Our Hacktober 2020 Goal: Add 100 District Attorneys 🎉
By the end of Hacktober, we hope to add **100 District Attorneys** to our web app. We need your help with gathering basic information, including:
- name
- role
- state
- county
- party
- age range
- gender
- race
- appointed date OR elected date
- headshot (profile picture)
- website
- wikipedia entry
- targeted google news search
- social media (facebook, twitter, instagram, linkedin, youtube)
- office address
- contact info: email
- contact info: phone
- any relevant articles (link, title, summary, feature image)

Whew! You see why we're looking for as many people as we can to help. That's a lot of simple data to mine.

## How You Can Help

### Instructions For Setting Up Git / GitHub in Terminal / Command Line (OPTIONAL; if you've done this in the past, you don't have to do it again)

1.) Find your public SSH key:
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

2.) Copy the key, including the `ssh-rsa` (but not your computer name)

3.) Go to your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/ssh)

4.) Paste in your SSH key

5.) You should be good to go! Email me if you have any trouble pushing to the repo.

### Instructions For Setting Up Your Local Environment

1.) [Fork this repo](https://github.com/billimarie/prosecutor-database/fork)

2.) Clone the forked repo to your local environment:
```
git clone git@github.com:[your username]/prosecutor-database.git
```

3.) Enter the repo:
```
cd prosecutor-database
```

4.) Make sure your branch is up-to-date with everyone else's work:
```
git fetch origin hacktober2020
```

5.) Create your branch:
```
git checkout hacktober2020
```

6.) Install the npm packages. 
```
npm install
```

### Instructions For Gathering Data

1.) Now, the fun part! It's time to start gathering data. Search through our [web app](https://us-prosecutor-database.herokuapp.com/) for a **District Attorney** in a state of your choosing. Click through their profile to see what information we have so far. (Example: search "California" & filter for "District Attorney").

2.) Once you find a missing District Attorney (or missing Profile Information about a District Attorney), visit our Google Sheet: [US Prosecutor Database - Profile Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Itwl8_jQpuXPjRH70fffEUSHvInfqbRKXg0iPEx8iCE/edit?usp=sharing). You can *add it to your own Google Drive* or *download it directly to your computer* as a CSV file.

3.) Time to Google! (Or Bing, or DuckDuckGo.) Use your favorite search engine to find information about District Attorneys in the state you chose. Start populating your [Basic Prosecutor Profile](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Itwl8_jQpuXPjRH70fffEUSHvInfqbRKXg0iPEx8iCE/edit?usp=sharing) sheet (aka, your CSV data) with whatever data you can verify. **Help: you can help with the import by deleting any columns that you don't collect; for example, a lot of people leave the `articles` columns blank. Please delete any columns which you don't collect information for. Thanks in advance!**

4.) Once you've finished populating your sheet, save/download the .CSV file to the repo folder. Then, install & run the `csvtojson` package (a CSV to JSON converter tool). This which will convert your [Basic Profile sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Itwl8_jQpuXPjRH70fffEUSHvInfqbRKXg0iPEx8iCE/edit?usp=sharing) .CSV file into a code format called JSON.
```
npm install -g csvtojson
csvtojson [your-file-name-here].csv > [your-file-name-here].json
```

### Instructions For Submitting Your Pull Request

1.) Time to **add**, **commit**, & **submit** your pull request:
```
git add .
git commit -m "[Your commit message goes here]"
git push origin hacktober2020:master
```

2.) Celebrate! 🎉 You'll receive a comment verifying I received your pull request. Once your PR has been merged, it'll be up on the [live web app](https://us-prosecutor-database.herokuapp.com/), & your GitHub profile will be added to the [Contributors](https://github.com/billimarie/prosecutor-database/blob/master/README.md#contributors) gallery.

## Troubleshooting

### Errors while trying to submit a pull request

1.) **Have you connected your SSH key to GitHub?** If not, go to "Step 1" in *Instructions For Setting Up Git / GitHub in Terminal / Command Line* (above). You might be getting an error because your SSH key isn't connected to GitHub.

2.) **Are you getting a `failed to push` error?** It looks like this:

```
To github.com:[your-username-here]/prosecutor-database.git
 ! [rejected]        hacktober2020 -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:[your-username-here]/prosecutor-database.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
```

If you see this in your terminal / command line, try `git push`. After pushing, go to your forked repository on GitHub.com & press "Pull Request." Select `hacktober2020` for the branch for your forked repo and the main repo. Press "Create Pull Request" and type a title and description for your PR.
